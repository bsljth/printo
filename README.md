## Printo

Printo (pronounced "print-o") is a Nim package that can be used to configure the timing of printing text on the terminal. There are 4 different modes to choose from. Printo can be used in any Nim application that supports version 1.6.14 and above. However, since Printo is a simple library that uses only basic Nim constructs, applications written in earlier versions of Nim should also be able to use it seamlessly.
